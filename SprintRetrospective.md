- What went well?
  - Developing the RTM help me understand the requirements and the motivations for the application beyond the surface-level understanding
  - Writing and testing the obvious test cases
- What could be improved?
  - Better Organization for AIO test cases
    - Put test cases under user stories within Jira rather than ID'ing the test cases in their name
    - Collect test cases into one if they only have just different datasets but the exact same procedure. It's more straightforward.
  - Set appropriate priority for defects (not all them should be medium)
- Next sprint?
  - Organize test cases within Jira by including user stories
  - More testing involving multiple creation and deletion operations
  - More testing to try to break the application (strange characters, empty names for celestial bodies)
  - Test whether functionality changes when logging out and logging in
  - Try different images other than those in the Celestial Images folder
